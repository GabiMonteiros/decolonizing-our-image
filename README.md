<h1 align="center">Decolonizing Our Image Website Project</h1>
<h3 align="center">The website is being developed for a personal research which I started 5 years ago. Based on the comparison of structure of images from the past centuries and the present day. Highlighting that racism is aesthetic and is the perpetuation of a structural image system that has been repeated since colonial times is a sophisticated way of controlling the images of everyone who does not look like the colonizers. </h3>
